# mbox2eml

_version 0.81, 2020-02-10_

Splits an mbox file into a bunch of eml files, extracting some (or all) of the
subjects and adding them to the filenames.

## Usage
`mbox2eml.py MBOX_FILE[s] [OUTPUT_DIR]`

If an output directory is not specified, a new directory named after the mbox
file is created automatically.

## Other stuff
See the file itself for version and author info.
